# Bailey Vaughan Portfolio
A portfolio for a 3D animator to show off recent works and programs they are knowledgable in. Also to provide a means of contact for future clients.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP

For this project I used HTML CSS and JS to build out the site and add animations such as delay animations for the program logos. GSAP introduced the horizontal scroll when the viewport is large enough that the user experience is not affected.

## Optimizations

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

A major optomization for this site was refactoring the mobile version. This began with removing the horizontal scroll as it felt awkward on the smaller viewport size as well as alternating the section colors in a way that was more visually noticable when scrolling on a mobile device the lack of structure seemed to be an issue for user experience. Refactoring the video was necessary to handle support of IOS, specifically for the thumbnail. Using #t=.01 added to end of video source tag allows it to start at .1 seconds and display the beginning of the video which was essentially the thumbnail on the desktop version.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned some differences on how IOS handles certain elements as some UX design changes for mobile versions of the site, especially when accounting for the number of visitors projected from a specific device.
