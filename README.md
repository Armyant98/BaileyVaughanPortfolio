# Bailey Vaughan Portfolio
A portfolio for a 3D animator to show off recent works and programs they are knowledgable in. Also to provide a means of contact for future clients.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP

For this project I used HTML CSS and JS to build out the site and add animations such as delay animations for the program logos. GSAP introduced the horizontal scroll when the viewport is large enough that the user experience is not affected.

## Optimizations

I learned about image compression differences for loading times. Also was able to streamline the scrolling to smooth scroll on all tested devices and browsers deemed necessary by the client. 

The background video proved to be the most troublesome to optimize, loading times could still be improved, but due to target audience being 3D animator recruiters, access to highspeed internet will likely not be an issue. However UX design choices were made for the mobile version highlighted by contrasting color changes and the removal of the horizontal scroll.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned some differences on how IOS handles certain elements as some UX design changes for mobile versions of the site, especially when accounting for the number of visitors projected from a specific device.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
